# Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering

This repository contains code for building a movie recommendation system using **item based collaborative filtering** techniques. The dataset used is a collection of movie ratings by users, allowing us to predict movie recommendations based on user preferences.

## Overview

## Dataset
1. Movie_Id_Titles.csv: Contains movie IDs and corresponding titles.
2. u.data: Includes user ratings for various movies.
3. My_Ratings.csv: Contains a list of 2 movies and their ratings.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- Libraries:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib
